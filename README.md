# Wasel Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how that information is used, under what circumstances we share information and the choices you can make about that information. This Policy applies when you access 
Wasel through a mobile app

# Information we collect
## 1. Information you provide to us or allow others to provide to us
At various points in the delivery experience, you may provide us with information about yourself. For example, when you create an account with Wasel, you provide us with personal information like your name, email address, and phone number. And if you place an order with Wasel, we collect information including your address, phone number, birth date, and the details of your order.
## 2. Technical information about the usage of Wasel
When you use the Wasel services, through our mobile app, we automatically receive some technical information about the hardware and software that is being used.
## 3. Location Permissions
By granting access to location services, you will be able to view the nearest shops and markets around you in order for you to place an order. Once an order is placed, you will be able to track your order in real time while your location is on and get notifications if the app was open in the background.
## Log information: When you use Wasel, our servers will record information about your usage of the service and information that is sent by your device. Logs information can include things like the IP address of your device, information about the operating system and/or app you are using, unique device identifiers, searches that you run on Wasel, and other ways you interact with the service. If you are logged into the Wasel service, this information is stored with your account information.
## How we use your information
We may use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:
Provide Wasel service to you and to improve the quality of the service we’re able to offer

## What we share
Wasel is a platform that connects users with Pickers who shop for and deliver the goods that users want from retailers. To facilitate the process, we need to share information about you and your order with the other parties who help enable the service. This includes, for example, the Picker who picks and delivers your order.
We also share information under the following principles:
If you have consented, we may allow carefully selected third parties, including marketing and advertising companies, our affiliates and associates, to contact you occasionally about services that may be of interest to you. They may contact you by telephone, SMS as well as by e-mail.

Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities
 Prevent, detect, or otherwise handle fraud, security, or technical issues
Protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, the public, or Wasel.
For business purposes — We may share your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. We may also share your information between and among Wasel, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
